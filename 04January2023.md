## Issues

### Designer Issue

I faced an issue with VS Code and Azure Logic App, where I was not able to open designer
It gave error stating that I cannot open socket and another error stating assembly missing.
The resolution was to re-install Function Core Tool after fully uninstalling it.

----------

### Debugging the logic app standard

Was not successful the logic app standard. The issue is related to extension bundle not being found.
