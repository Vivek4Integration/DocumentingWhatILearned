> **For Few days I have been distracted and hence was not able to track what I want to learn and what I learned.**

## Todo for the day

Following are the todo, I have for this day,

- [X] Logic App, look into creating few simple Azure Logic app application.
  
### Logic App Sample

  Today I intend to complete watching the logic app video on debugging [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_V7xfASK-rM).
  
  Update 00:51 AM:
  Went through the aforementioned video and created first sample mentioned in the video i.e., xml to json transformation with stateful workflow.

 [ ] TODO: Go through custom connectors in detail.

  Going through second video, one by Steef-Jan Wiggers [Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xWP7V2jmSc).

 [X] TODO: Add the solution I created to GitHub.
 Completed above todo, while doing so learned a quite a bit about creating remote repository for already existing local repo.
 Recommended commands are as follows,

 ```console
 git remote add origin <remote repo url>
 git push -u -f origin master
 ```

## Issues

Slept at 3AM which is not good. Failed in habit of sleeping early.
But did achieve some of the goals, which I set out to do. Got basic understanding of Azure Logic App standard and was able to relate to what was being conveyed in meeting by Big Heads like Wagner and Steef.
